# Chris Biscardi: Sept 19 - Oct 3

## What level are you operating at?

Same as [2024-09-05](2024-09-05.md)

## What are your goals for your content?

Same as [2024-09-05](2024-09-05.md)

## What did you do in the last two weeks towards your goals.

I shipped a This Week in Bevy every week, accumulating two more weeks towards my year-long goal.

- [x] 2 more This Week in Bevy videos on Mondays
- [x] 2 additional videos for Tuesdays
- [x] 2 live streams on Saturdays
- [ ] (missed) At least 1 short for This Week in Bevy

longer term:

- Made progress on the 0.14 2048 Bevy workshop
- [x] Finished another segment on the wasm basics workshop
- [ ] (missed) Ship my new personal website (leptos 0.7-beta version)
- [ ] (missed) Generate emails for This Week in Bevy
  - Potentially send the first one, but most likely just set up the templating
- [x] Write some documentation for Bevy in book-ish form
  - I wrote some, but not sure it makes sense to continue at the moment. Will evaluate with other workload.


## Is there anything new you're going to try in the next two weeks?

Bevy 0.15's release candidate is happening soon, likely this weekend but maybe later. I have a lot of code and content to update over the next couple weeks as the release-candidate cycle happens. I want to be ahead enough on my own work that I can contribute substantially to the release-notes and other release-candidate cycle efforts.

I missed shipping shorts last cycle, so am going to commit to shipping at least one this cycle. I think I missed because I don't have a good, easy to run workflow to execute to make them. This will partially come from making more and partially from thinking about how to fit shorts creation into my existing workflows, like This Week in Bevy, other longform videos, or pulling clips from livestreams.

Concretely this means shipping

- 2 more This Week in Bevy videos on Mondays
- 2 additional videos for Tuesdays
- 2 live streams on Saturdays
- At least 1 short from one of the previously mentioned sources

I'm also planning to:

- Finish updates to the 0.14 2048 Bevy workshop
- Finish another segment on the wasm basics workshop
- Ship my new personal website (leptos 0.7-beta version)
- Generate emails for This Week in Bevy
  - Potentially send the first one, but most likely just set up the templating

and I see the most time being taked up by 0.15 Bevy updates. This is a major update with widespread ramifications on the workshops and code examples I maintain, so that will be my primary focus over the next two weeks.

## Farther future

- In testing for the Rust Adventure redesign work, I want to pick and implement Search on my personal site with an intent to do the same implementation on Rust Adventure in the future.
