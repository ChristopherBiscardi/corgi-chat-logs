## What level are you operating at?

## What are your goals for your content?

Same as [2024-09-05](2024-09-05.md)

## What did you do in the last two weeks towards your goals.

I shipped a This Week in Bevy every week, accumulating two more weeks towards my year-long goal.

- [x] 2 of 2 This Week in Bevy issues published
- [x] 1 of 2 more This Week in Bevy videos on Mondays
- [x] 1 of 2 additional videos for Tuesdays
- [x] 2 live streams on Saturdays
- [x] 1 short for This Week in Bevy

longer term:

- Made progress on the 0.14 2048 Bevy workshop
- [ ] (missed) Ship my new personal website (leptos 0.7-beta version)
- [ ] (missed) Generate emails for This Week in Bevy
  - Potentially send the first one, but most likely just set up the templating

### What I'm doing about misses

I'm going to carve out specific time in my calendar to handle the email generation, and commit to specific time to finish my personal website transition.

## Is there anything new you're going to try in the next two weeks?

Bevy 0.15's release candidate is still "happening soon" and I have a lot to update over the next four weeks as the release candidate cycle comes in.

I don't have the weekend time to save myself this week from any workflow deficiencies in this week in bevy production, so before I leave for the weekend I need to have the vast majority of it done. This should leave me with about 24 hours of events to process when I get back.

I was able to make a short last week, but youtube's 3 min shorts hasn't quite kicked in yet. I'm mostly planning to focus on youtube shorts instead of tiktok and such.

Concretely this means shipping

- 2 more This Week in Bevy videos on Mondays
- 2 additional videos for Tuesdays
- 2 live streams on Saturdays
- At least 1 short from one of the previously mentioned sources

I'm also planning to:

- Finish updates to the 0.14 2048 Bevy workshop
- Start the 0.15 2048 workshop code
- Finish another segment on the wasm basics workshop
- Ship my new personal website (leptos 0.7-beta version)
- Generate emails for This Week in Bevy
  - Potentially send the first one, but most likely just set up the templating

and I see the most time being taked up by 0.15 Bevy updates. This is a major update with widespread ramifications on the workshops and code examples I maintain, so that will be my primary focus over the next two weeks.

## Farther future

- In testing for the Rust Adventure redesign work, I want to pick and implement Search on my personal site with an intent to do the same implementation on Rust Adventure in the future.
