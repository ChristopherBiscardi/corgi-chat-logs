# Chris Biscardi: Aug 22 - Sept 5

## What level are you operating at?

For social sites, I mostly focus on YouTube long-form videos. Secondarily I post to TikTok and YouTube shorts.

I also run a game development newsletter which distributes on YouTube, a website, and (soon) a newsletter.

My general content development pipeline places exploratory or "in-need-of-validation" content on YouTube and eventually through iterations that ends up with polished written and video content on Rust Adventure (https://www.rustadventure.dev/).

Rust Adventure is a subscription educational site where the videos are behind a paywall and the written content is freely available. This means that it can land for SEO purposes, be accessible to those that can't afford a subscription, and support the extra work that goes into video and polished workshop production.

I ship a video every monday and tuesday, and I stream on Saturdays.

## What are your goals for your content?

Subscriptions to Rust Adventure support all of my efforts, so increasing that by building long-term trust is my primary goal at the end of the day. I can't continue to produce if I can't support myself in doing so, and I think that long-term behavior that supports specific communities is the best way to deliver value people will pay for. I specifically avoid clickbait and "fear of missing out/emotional leverage" approaches for this and other reasons.

Additionally I focus on solving problems for specific communities. Right now I'm heavily involved in the Rust and Bevy game engine communities.

One of my goals is to grow alongside the Bevy community. Its a promising engine that I believe has a promising future and there's a significant lack of educational material around, partially due to how fast it moves (which presents its own challenges) and partially due to how young it is. This is a long-term goal on the order of years for me, so the concrete weekly work is survey the questions people are stumbling over the most and provide answers in a widely-consumable way.

On a smaller scale, my next goal for "This Week in Bevy" is to have shipped an issue every week for a year. (I'm about halfway through).

## What did you do in the last two weeks towards your goals.

I shipped a This Week in Bevy every week, accumulating two more weeks towards my year-long goal. These videos are lower-view count compared to other videos I could be making, but that is a conscious tradeoff because they're something I want to be doing and are part of a longer-term strategy.

I also shipped the first in a new format package called "Labs" which looks at software features that have merged or are labelled experimental by their projects. The one I shipped was a "Bevy Labs" video which covered a feature that came up in the comments in a This Week in Bevy, motivating the new format.

There's a post that I want to ship on my peronsal site, relating to Bevy's 4th birthday, which requires shipping a new site this weekend. I already have the site in staging, I just need to figure out how comfortable I am with cutting some URLs and features.

I finished writing a talk for Rust Conf which I'll be giving next week.

## Is there anything new you're going to try in the next two weeks?

My intention is to keep the motivation moving forward from giving the Rust Conf talk and produce more Leptos/Wasm/Rust videos on YouTube as well as finish a Wasm basics workshop for Rust Adventure that I've had sitting on the shelf for a bit too long. As Leptos hits 0.7, I'll ramp up production for that release cycle as well.

I'm going to take the week I'm speaking almost entirely off, but try to produce some videos that can go out while I'm "away", including the weekly This Week in Bevy and a "Bevy Labs" video.

Beyond that I want to experiment with new ways to produce more writing. Whether that's setting aside additional dedicated time each day or something else. The biggest limiting factor on Rust Adventure Workshops is the volume of writing it takes to produce or update one, and writing in general can drive anything I produce so increases in the amount I can or do write are big for me.

Concretely this means shipping

- 2 more This Week in Bevy videos on Mondays
- 2 additional videos for Tuesdays
- 1 live stream on Saturday, (the second doesn't happen because I have a flight)

I'll also record some video on my trip/speaking engagement, but I don't know if that will turn into a video or not yet. Recording the extra video is the goal.

I also think that This Week in Bevy could feed itself into more shorts more often, so I'd like to figure out a good workflow for that when I'm making the longer form videos and issues.

## Farther future

- I started a redesign of Rust Adventure to be more focused around the content. This will take a bit of time but it doesn't block anything else (like workshop development).
