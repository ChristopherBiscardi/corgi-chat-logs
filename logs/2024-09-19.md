## What level are you operating at?

Same as [2024-09-05](2024-09-05.md)

## What are your goals for your content?

Same as [2024-09-05](2024-09-05.md)

## What did you do in the last two weeks towards your goals.

I shipped a This Week in Bevy every week, accumulating two more weeks towards my year-long goal.

I shipped my "Bevy's 4th birthday" post as a gist instead of redoing the DNS on my personal site before leaving for the Rust Conf.

I gave a talk on Rust/Wasm/Leptos at [Rust Conf 2024](https://rustconf.com/) which went well.

and I took a week "off" of writing/content production.

## Is there anything new you're going to try in the next two weeks?

I recorded a bunch of video at the conference (not of the conference though) and I'm at least going to go through and process it even if I don't ship the result on youtube.

My intention is to keep the motivation moving forward from giving the Rust Conf talk and produce more Leptos/Wasm/Rust videos for YouTube as well as finish a Wasm basics workshop for Rust Adventure that I've had sitting on the shelf for a bit too long. As Leptos hits 0.7, I'll ramp up production for that release cycle as well.

Concretely this means shipping

- 2 more This Week in Bevy videos on Mondays
- 2 additional videos for Tuesdays
- 2 live streams on Saturdays, (the second doesn't happen because I have a flight)
- At least 1 short for This Week in Bevy

I'm also planning to:

- Finish updates to a 2048 Bevy workshop
- Finish another segment on the wasm basics workshop
- Ship my new personal website (leptos 0.7-beta version)
- Generate emails for This Week in Bevy
  - Potentially send the first one, but most likely just set up the templating
- Write some documentation for Bevy in book-ish form

## Farther future

- The Rust Adventure redesign got some good planning work as to what and how that's going to happen. I anticipate shipping this redesign next year.
